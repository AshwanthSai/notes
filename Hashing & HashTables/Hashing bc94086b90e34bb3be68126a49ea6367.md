# Hashing

Hashtable is a data structure, hashing is a technique.

**Used to implements key value pairs, or just set of keys.** 

**There are no duplicates allowed, duplication overides previous key.**

- What is the primary advantage ?
    
    **Key advantage - Search, Insert and Delete in O(1) Time in Average. Beats any other data structure for this particular data structure.**
    
- What is it not usefull for ? **R**
    
    Finding Closest Value
    
    Sorted Data - Order of data within hashtable cannot be guaranteed.
    
    Prefix Searching - Search using prefix.

- Applications of Hashing?
    
    Hashtable is used in all fields of computer science, second most used data structure. 
    
    Implementation in
    
    1. Dictionaries. Lookup in constant time.
    2. Database Indexing - Indexing can be using, hashtables or B/ B+ trees.
    3. Cryptography - Password is never stored. The password you enter is converted to hash. compared with the hash in the database.
    4. Cache  - used to implement cache. Used within cache of browser, where site information is cached, key is URL.
    5. Symbol Tables in Compiler/ Interpreters  
    6. Routers - Hashatables used in Routers to map Mac Addresses.
    7. Getting data from Databases - Fetching data from tables, Associative arrays.

### Concept behind Hashing - Direct Address Table

---

- Direct Addressing Table - Use keys as addresses
    
    Utilize a large boolean array of maybe length 1000. For change in range of keys reduce it from index. For inserting, go to address and toggle to one. 
    
    For deleting go to address and toggle to 0.
    
    For change in range of keys say for example, 1000 - 1999. Reduce 1000 from range, table[i - 100];

- Example
    
    ASCII Characters
    
- Problems?
    
    Cannot handle large keys- Phone numbers Keys or 
    
    or Floating Point Numbers Keys or
    
    String Keys or Any other type of Keys
    

### How to address Direct Addressing Table Problems

---

- Use a Hashfunction
    
    Pass universe of strings, pass into a hash function and convert to smaller values which can be used as an index in a Hashtable.
    
    Here hashtable size will be proportional to universe of keys. You want to create K keys for N Possible Universe of Keys. K proportional N

- **Hashtable requirements?**
    
    Where m is the size of hashtable. 
    
    Large Phone Number Strings → Keys 0 - 99 → Table of Size 100 - **Most important ability to distribute these 100 into unique indvidual hash numbers.**
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%203.png)
    
- Example Hash Function of Integers
    
    here m is the size of the hashtable.
    
    h(large_key) = large_key % m. Sometimes the hash generated might be same for large_key.
    
    This is called collision. 
    
    **M generally is choosen as prime number close to hashtable size. Less common factors, better distribution of values. Avoid numbers close to 2s power (last 3 bits in the numbers), 10s Power(last 3 digits of phone number ignoring other 7 numbers) .**
    
- Example Hash Function to Strings
    
    Use weighted sum to avoid permutation problem
    
    str[0] is the ASCII value of string a. M is the size of hashtable, x is a choosen random number Maybe 33. 
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%204.png)
    
- Most common  - Universal Hashing
    
    Have a set of hash functions, choose a set of hash function at radom and hash, for every new instance of hashing.
    

### Collision Handling

Birthday Paradox - 23 - 50%, 80 - 99.9%. Collision is bound to happen, because we cannot know keys in advance.

---

- What is perfect hashing?
    
    If we know keys in advance, we can preprocess our data and make sure no collision happens
    
    This is called perfect hashing, used in dictionaries.
    
- What are two collision reduction strategies ?
    1. Chaining
    2. Open Addressing 
    

### Chaining

---

- What is the concept behind chaining?
    
    Use an array of linked list.
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%205.png)
    
- Performance of Chaining
    
    M = number of slots in the hash table.
    
    N = number of keys to be inserted.
    
    **Load Factor Alpha = N/M. Lower load factor means less collision and vice versa**
    
    **Expected Chain Length - Worst Case, Every Key is attached to same slot. Chain Length is N.**
    
    **Average Case, we assume - It is uniformly distributed. Chain Length is One, Alpha is One**
    
    Expected Time to Search - O(1 + Alpha), 1 for hashing, Alpha for Traversal of chain.
    
    Expected Time to Insert/Delete - O(1 + Alpha) 1 for hashing, Alpha for Traversal of chain..
    When alpha is one, Serch, Insert and Delete is O(1).
    
- Data Structure for Storing Chains
    
    Linked List - Search O(L), Delete O(L), Insert O(L) - L is the length of chain. 
    
    Linked List - not cache friendly, extra space to store reference of next. 
    
    Dynamic Sized Array - Cache friendly, Search, Insert and Delete are O(L) because values are stored randomly.
    
    Self Balancing BST - AVL or RedBlack Tree -  O(Log L) 3 Op. Not Cache Friendly
    
- Implementation of Chaining. **[Missed]**

### Open Addressing

---

- What is the basic concept of Open Addressing?
    
    Use a single array only. Instead of Linkedlist.
    
    meaning. No of slots in hashtable ≥ no of keys to be inserted. 
    
    Advantage - Cache Friendl.
    
    Multiple ways to implement Open Addressing.
    
- Linear Probing
    
    Linearly Search for the next empty slot, when there is a collision.
    
    If the last slot is filled, linearly search from top, round robin fashion
    
    Here 48 and 55 come into the same slot, since 48 is filled. Push 55 to slot 2.
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%206.png)
    
- Searching in Linear Probing
    
    Stop in one for the three cases.  1 . Key found, Emply Slot, Traverse through whole table.
    
    If 15 not found, start linear search, if you find empty slot return. 
    
    If slot is full, traverse entire table and start from one till you reach your index - Smart corner case.
    
- Deletion Problem in Linear Probing
    
    If you delete 51, and keep the slot as empty, seach will break, so never leave empty, mark slot as deleted.
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%207.png)
    
- Mathematically Representing Linear Probing.
    
    Easy stuff, if key is occupied increase i to one, to two etc.
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%208.png)
    
- Problem Two in Linear Probing
    
    Clustering - With each colision you are make a cluster of two slots. Cluster K.
    
    With every increase in collision you are making the cluster grow by k + 1
    
    With increase in cluster, every operation becomes more and more expensive. 
    
    Immediate forming cluster is the problem, because it affects search.
    
- Quadratic Probing
    1. Quadratic Probing - (h(key) + i square)  % m. 
    
    Problem is secondary clusters are formed, probe sequence is the same. But better than primary clustering. 
    
    It could also be possible that, you dont find an appropiate slot to place the item. 
    
    **Use Quadratic Probing when, alpha is < 0.5 i.e, M is double of N and M is prime. Guarantees placement.** 
    
- Double Hashing
    - What is the concept behind double hashing?
        
        On collision use a secondary hash function. Secondary hash should never be zero.
        
    - Advantages
        
        Why Relatively prime to m?
        
        ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%209.png)
        
- Double Hashing Example [Repeat Once More]
    
    Hash(key, i) = (h1(key) + i * h2(key)) % m
    
    Where I is collision count, First Collision, Second Collision, Third Collision at location.
    
    When encoutering colloision even after second hash, increase counter.
    
    ![Untitled](Hashing%20bc94086b90e34bb3be68126a49ea6367/Untitled%2010.png)
    
- Why should h2 key be relatively prime to m?
    
    **if h2 key is realtively prime, double hashing ensures item in placed in hash table**
    
    for linear probing, shift for collision was by 1.
    
    for quadratic probing, shift was by 1square, 2square etc.
    
    for double hashing, Assume h2 key to be 6.
    
    for the array of size 7, with increase in collision. Ensures the item is checked for all other slots. 
    
    Numbers are called relatively prime if, When two numbers have no common factors other than 1. You can be design make the key relatively prime by observing M, 
    
    here H2  = 6 - (key % 6) = value is always closer to 6.

### Analysis of Search

Open addressing Alpha should be at most 1 ( ≤ 1).

For Quadratic Alpha should atmost half.

Universal Hashing - Atmost One. Similiar to Linear Hashing

---

**Alpha = 0.8 implies, 80 % is filled and 20 % is free.**

**1/ 5 is free. so unsucessfull search maximum is 5**

**Alpha = 0.9 implies, 90 % is filled and 10 % is free.**

**1/10th is free, so maximum unsuccessfull search is 10. 9 occupied , 1 free.**

**General Formula, 1/ 1 - Alpa, where 1 - Alpa is the fraction of table that is empty**.

### Comparison of Chaining V/S Open Addressing

---

- Tabular difference - R
    
    Less sensitive to hash functions - Clusters do not affect each other. 
    
    Alpha denotes performance - need to revise again. 
    
    Use Open Addressing - if you know the count of keys to be coming in advance.
    
    Chaining - Dynamic Structure. Better Collision Handling, Better Performance.
