# Heap

Used to implement Heapsort, **PriorityQue**.
PriorityQue is used in all major algorithms.
In real world, implementation of Heap uses dynamically sized arrays are used.

Any Situaton where there is items in a que with priorities.

---

- What is the analogy for priority que?
    
    Doctors Que, With patients with different priorities waiting to meet a single doctor.
    
    Doctor always visit the highest priority person, first and then the next highest priority.
    
- What are two ways to assign priorities?
    
     Min Heap - Highest priority person is given the lowest value. 
    
    Max Heap - Highest priority item is assigned highest value. 
    

### Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree

A binary tree is called complete, if all levels are completely filled, except the last level. Last level has to be filled from left to right, with no gaps in between. 

---

- Example of complete and non complete binary tree?
    
    Gap in second one.

- When is a complete binary tree used? What is the formula for parent, left and right child ?
    
    Heap is generally represented as an array with no gaps.
    
    If gaps are present, space is wasted and parent child relationship is broken. 
    
    Paren is of form floor value, f(x) = ⌊x⌋ = Largest Nearest Integer of specified value.

- What is the advantage of having a complete binary tree?
    
    Array with no gaps having proper parent child relationship offers, random access and cache friendliness[contigous locations], 
    
    Advantage - Height of the tree is minimum possible because it is a complete binary tree, no wasted space for storing null reference. 
    

### Min Heap

---

- **What are the properties of Min Heap?**
    
    **Complete Binary Tree.**
    
    **Every Node has value smaller than its descendants.** 
    
- How is Min Heap represented?
    
    Min Heap is internally represented as an Array. The Tree is only a pictorial representation.
    
- Basic Min Heap Implementation

- Inserting into Min Heap?
    
    Inserting into array, keeping basic properties of min heap intact. 
    
    - What is the basic idea of inserting in Binary Heap.
        
        Increase size, insert item at last index.
        
        Insert item into array. Making Complete Binary Tree.
        
        Check if node is greater than parent, if not swap. 
        Swap until the node is greater than parent or if we have reached root.
        
    - What is the complexity of Insert Operation?
        
        Inserting into array is O(1).
        In worst case we have to travel towards the height of binary tree.
        
        Height of binary tree is log n. So operation is O(long n).

### Heapify Operation

Used as subroutine in many standard operations like extract minimum, build heap. 

---

- What is heapify pictorially?
    
    Fixing wrong allocation at a node, here node is the root.

- How does heapify function work, recursively Pictorially ?

- Implementation of minHeapify Function?
    
    ![Untitled](Heap%20c93312e4c6e24b5d9c8f7933841c957c/Untitled%206.png)
    
- Time Complexity?
    
    Best Case only the root modifies, O(1)
    
    Worst Case, Call goes till node at last H, O(H).
    H = logn as it is a complete tree. 
    
    Auxilliary Space  = O(H), if written recursively. 
    
    O(1) if written iteratively.
    

### Extract Minimum

getHeap - return minimum element, O(1). 

Extract Minimum is removing item from binary tree. 

---

- What is the working steps for removing item?
    
    Swap minimum item with last item in array.
    
    Reduce size. 
    
    Call minHeapify on root.

- Implementation of Extract Item?
    
    Handling, size one as base case, otherwise minheapify does not work.
    
    ![Untitled](Heap%20c93312e4c6e24b5d9c8f7933841c957c/Untitled%208.png)
    
- Complexity?
    
    Time Complexity - 1 (for swapping), long n for minheapify. O(longn)
    
    Auxillary Space - O(1) if written iteratively, if recursive then O(long n).
