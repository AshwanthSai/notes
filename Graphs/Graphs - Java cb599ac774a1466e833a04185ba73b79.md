# Graphs - Java

Tree uses parent child relationship. Consider a relationship between friends, these are random and can have cycles between them [Common Friends]. In such situations you use a graph data structure.

- How are graphs represented?
    
    G = {V,E} Represented as set of vertices and edges.
    
    V= {V1,V2,V3,V4}
    
    E = {(V1,V2), (V2,V3), (V3,V4)} - Graph with three edges.
    
- What are directed v/s undirected graphs? When are they ordered and unordered.
    
    Directed are graphs with edges with direction of relationships/paths
    
    In left graph you have to specify (v1,v2) in this particular order(Ordered) for right graph you can specify (v1,v2) in any order (Unordered)

- Give an example of an undirected graph?
    
    Social network is an example of an undirected graph.
    Here if V1 and V2 are friends, then (V1,V2) are friends and (V2,V1) are friends.

- Give an example of directed graph?
    
    World Wide Web, Consider V1 as server and V2 as clients, Server pushes pages to clients. Clients cannot push pages to server. Or Page V1 has a link to page V2.

- What is degree of an undirected graph?
    
    Degree - Number of Edges going through it.
    
- What is types of degrees in a directed graph?
    
    In Degree - Number of edges going through it.
    
    Out Degree - Number of edges going out of it.
    
- What is the formula for sum of degrees in undirected graph? Why?
    
    Sum of Degrees = 2 * Number of Edges
    
- What is the formula for sum of degrees in directed graph? Why?
    
    Sum of Indegree = Number of Edges.
    
    Sum of Outdegree  = Number of Edges. 
    
    Because every outdegree is also an indegree for an other vertice.
    
- **What is the formula for maximum number of edges in directed graph?**
    
    Ignoring self loops.
    
    Such graphs are called complete graphs
    
    (V )* (V - 1) = Every Vertice can be connected to any other vertice except itself. so V * V- 1
    
- **What is the formula for maximum number of edges in undirected graph?**
    
    (V )* (V - 1)/2.
    
    One edge represents two way connection.
    
    Such graphs are called complete graphs
    Every Vertice can be connected to any other vertice except itself, / 2 because connection is both ways.
    
- What is walk? This is also known as ?
    
    Sequence of vertices, when following edges. 
    
    Sometimes refered to as path.
    
    V1,V2,V4,V2

- What is a Path? This is also known as ?
    
    Path is a special walk with no repetitions of vertices.
    
    Sometimes refered as simple path.

- What is a Cycle? How do directed cyclic, directed acyclic graphs look?
    
    A graphs is said to have a cycle, if there exists a simple path, which starts and ends in the same vertex.

- When is a Graph Cyclic and Acyclic ? Give examples of Directed Cyclic and Un Directed Cyclic graphs?
    
    A graph is said to be Acyclic, if it does not contain a cycle.

- What is weighted graphs and unweighted graphs? Can you give an example?
    
    A weighted graph is a graph with weights associated with edges. 
    
    Realwold example includes - A roadmap network, with weights representing the length of paths.
    
    World Wide Web.

### Representation of Graphs

Graphs are represented in computers using 

1. Adjacency Matrix  2. Adjacency List.

- How does Adjacency Matrix represented? What does I and J represent.
    
    I represents source vetex, J represents destination vertex/
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%208.png)
    
- What is an intresting property for the adjacency matrix for undirected graphs?
    
    There is a symmetry in the adjacency matrix, because in undirected graphs, A to B is same as B to A. This is simple.
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%209.png)
    
- Give an Example of an Ajacency Matrix for an Undirected Graph?
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%2010.png)
    
- How is Adjacency Matrix adjusted for vertices with String values, example graph of cities ?
    
    Store vertex names in an array of strings and simplify. Abstraction - Smart. To find vertices, linearly traverse the array. 
    
    For effective implementation, use a hashmap. 
    
    Say for example, find the vertices that are adjacent to CDE, you can identify vertices and call key from hashmap without traversing the array. 
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%2011.png)
    
- Time complexity of adjacency matrix?
    1. O(1) because this is a single operation.
    2. Iterate V times to find adjacent vertices O(V)
    3. Same as above.
    4. Example, 2 to 3,  got to 2 remove 1 from 3.  go to three remove 1 from 2. O(1) single step operation. 
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%2012.png)
    
- Why is add/remove a vertex O(V Square)?
    
    Adding and removing a vertex is On2 because you have to create a new array with greater size, 
    
    read and paste all elements again. Which is v2, adding new array element and filling is v 
    
    so ON2 + V. 
    

### Why Adjacency List?

Matix is storing, redundant information. Infomration of what edges are not connected, this can be deduced easily. So lets just use a list. Saves Space, reducing iteration steps. List can be arraylist, linked list, dynamic arrays. **Adjacency List -  List of Lists. Popular Lists - Dynamic Sized Arrays, Linked List.**

---

- What is an Ajacency List?
    
    **Adjacency List - Array of Lists.** 
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%2013.png)
    
- What are advantages/disadvantage of Dynamic Sized Arrays?
    
    Cache Friendly - Cache friendly code tries to keep accesses close together in memory so that you minimize cache misses.
    
    Disadvantage sometimes you will need to copy arrays to extend size. This could take O(N) instead of O(1)(Addition Operation).
    
- **Example of Adjacency list for directed graph?**
    
    Ideally only outgoing edges are depicted
    
    ![Untitled](Graphs%20-%20Java%20cb599ac774a1466e833a04185ba73b79/Untitled%2014.png)
    
- Complexity of Adjacency List? Always draw a sample list and think of worst case.
    
    Space Complexity 
    
    Directed - O(V + E), Undirected - O(V + 2E). Connection from 1 - 2, will also show 2 to 1 in our adjacency list. 
    
    Check if there is an edge from u to v - Think interms of steps, go to array of position u, iterate list until you find v. O(V)
    
    Find all adjacent of U- O(degrees of (u)) or O(V) similiar to above.
    
    Find degree of U - O(1) - Size of list connected to array item.
    
    Add an edge - O(I) - add vertex to list, two times.
    
    Remove an edge - O(V), think of worst case
    
    Number of Adjacent Vertex  of V = Degree of the Vertex V

### Comparison of Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix

Range of Edges

 0 ≤ E ≤ V * V - 1 for directed graphs

 0 ≤ E ≤ V * V - 1/2  for undirected graphs
Dense Graph - When E is close to maximum, Sparse Graph - When E is much less than maximum.

In General use list. Most suited for sparse graphs. 

---

- What is the primary advantage of Adjacency List ?
    
    Space Complexity.
    
    Find All Adjacent of u - This is used by all major algorithms. 
    
    In Lists - Go to item, fetch size() and return. O(1)
    
    In Arrays - Go to item, iterate, check 0 or 1. return O(V)

### Breadth First Search - Graph Traversal Mechanism.

- What is the story?
    
    Think of you as a source in a social network. You want to print all the names of your friends that can you reach immediatedly(directly or via a intermediate friends)
    
    Print all your immediate friends. Print all the immediate friends of your immediate friends.
    
    Take O as you, Print all your immediate friends in any order.
    
    0,1,2,5 
    
    immediate friend of 1 - 3
    
    immediate friend of 2 - 4 
    
    Overall 0,1,2,5,3,4
