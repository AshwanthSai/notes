### Analysis of Algorithms

- Why Analyze Algorithms ?
    
    For a given problem, there are N number of solutions. Which solution do we select?
    
- Why Asymptotic Analysis ?
    
    Speed of Algorithms, can vary with - 
    
    Computational Power - Computer on which it is running.
    
    Compiled Languages - C/C++ faster than Java/Python.
    
    System Load at time of running. 
    
    Input type, certain inputs take more time in some functions. 
    
    To avoid all these, we use Asymptomatic analysis.
    
- **What is the idea of Asymptotic Analysis ? Important**
    
    Measure the order of growth of steps taken by function with increase in input size.
    
- **What is the formal method to find Asymptotic Analysis?**
    
    After Input 4, func2 will always take more time than func1 regardless of speed of the system.
    
    For even slower machine, value of N will be higher. 
    
    For fun2, Miscellanous work is C3[Initialization and things]
    
    For fun3, Works is nsquare/2 + n/2 + Some Miscellanous work

- Analysis Example
    
    You find that, fun1 take 13 seconds, the expression for func2 is  2N + 5. 
    
    At point 4, both expressions intersect. 
    
    After Input 4 func will always be slower than func1. 
    
    This is the beauty of order of growth.

    Running same code on a Mobile. Using Asymptotatic analysis, in this case n is higher.
    
    After 999, func1 is always going to take more time.

- Basic Workflow
    1. Figure out time taken, in all solutions.  Find Polynomial 
    2. Determine Order of Growth. 

### Order of Growth

---

- How to determine order of growth?
    
    Order of growth is the leading term of the work expression.

### Mathematics of Order of Growth

---

- How to compare order of growth ?
    
    Here N is input size. Here g(n) is better algorithm, as compared to f(n).
    
    Generally we consider n tends to infinite, worst case scenario.

- Working Example ?

### Comparing Order of Growth - Used in Real World

---

- Direct Comparison, by just looking at the Leading Term

- Working Example
    
    For 1, loglogn is ignored ad N is of higher order. 
    
    f(n) is better for one.
    
    g(n) is better for two.

### Best, Average and Worst Case - Important

---

- How do we compute **average** case ?
    
    Assume an input size, say for example assume users put 1000 inputs here.
    
    Half of them will be even and half of them will be odd. 
    
    Average case here is still N.
    
    ![Untitled](Introduction%201a464400c0964c6fb6957af4e7326a52/Untitled%208.png)
    
- **Computing Average Case always involve ?**
    
    Generally always involves some form of assumption of input type, number of inputs or even know the exact input type. So generally not used.
    
    Best case is generally not used. No body cares how fast it runs in a certain input size.
    
    Worst case is generally used.
    

In the real world, you say this is the order of growth for worst case for this particular algorithm.
