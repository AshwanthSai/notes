### Analysis of Algorithms

- Why ?
    
    For a given problem, there are N number of solutions. Which solution do we select?
    
- Why Asymptotic Analysis ?
    
    Computational Power - Computer on which it is running.
    
    Compiled Languages - C/C++ faster than Java/Python.
    
    System Load at time of running. 
    
    Input type, certain inputs take more time in some functions. 
    
    To avoid all these, we use Asymptomatic analysis.
    
- **What is the idea of Asymptotic Analysis ?**
    
    Measure the order of growth of steps taken by function with increase in input size.
    
- What is the formal method to find Asymptotic Analysis?
    
    After Input 4, func2 will always take more time than func1 regardless of speed of the system.
    
    For even slower machine, value of N will be higher.
