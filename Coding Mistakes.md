# Coding Mistakes.

1. Always reduce the number of variables used. Try to use while loop. 
2. Always place guard first and condition second - prevents unwanted checks.
3. Local variables can be seen in debugger, which will make it faster to debug.
4. Always use print statements, helps improve problem solving. 
5. Do not BRUTEFORCE. Why would you do that. 
Do not run without dry run. Why would you set yourself to failure.
6. Do not use this reference call in recrusive functions. Always ask why you are failing. 
7. Ask yourself what you are missing, go word by word. Slowly. Understand what is happening. Coding is a draining activity, make sure every session is worth it. 
8. Write and paper and execute. Why would write code first ? Think interms of program variant, invariant and guard. Precondition and postcondition. Solve on paper and move to code.
9. If there are tests. Check each test for every method. This gives you clarity.
