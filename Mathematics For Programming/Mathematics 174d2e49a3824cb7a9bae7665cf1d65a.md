### Geometric Progression

Here d is r. 

---

- What is the formula for nth term?
    
    Anth = a  * r raised to (n - 1)
    
- What is the formula for sum of nth term ?
    
    Sum = A * (1 - R raised to n) / 1 - R

### Prime Numbers

---

- What are prime numbers?
    
    Numbers which can only be divisible by one and itself.
    
- What are two important facts about prime numbers?
    
    Two and Three are the only consecutive natural prime numbers. 
    
    All prime numbers except two and three can be represented as 6N + 1 or 6 N - 1. Where N is a natural number.
